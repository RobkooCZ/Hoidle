        <p><br>As you can see, Hearts of Iron IV isn't difficult to run. You can run it with very old hardware, but I have to warn you, in the 40s in game, it gets really laggy.</p>
        <!-- Paragraph about difficulty -->
        <p><br><b>Difficulty</b><br>Hearts of Iron IV can be quite challenging for newcomers due to its complex strategic gameplay and steep learning curve. The game requires a solid understanding of military tactics, resource management, and diplomatic intricacies during World War II.
