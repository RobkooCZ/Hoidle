      <p><br>As you can see, Hearts of Iron IV isn't difficult to run. You can run it with very old hardware, but I have to warn you, in the 40s in game, it gets really laggy.</p>
      <p><br><b>Difficulty</b><br>Hearts of Iron IV can be quite challenging for newcomers due to its complex strategic gameplay and steep learning curve. The game requires a solid understanding of military tactics, resource management, and diplomatic intricacies during World War II. Players must navigate through intricate political systems, handle diverse armies, and make crucial decisions that can alter the course of history. The vast array of options for research, production, and division design adds depth but also demands strategic foresight. The dynamic nature of global conflicts and the need to adapt to unforeseen challenges make mastering HoI4 a rewarding yet demanding experience, especially for those new to grand strategy games.</p>
